## **Description** 
#

In this project, I have created a dynamic web application that helps a user plan out their day-to-day tasks. The daily planner is to assist users throughout their work day, allowing them to store information within a text area, and when that user refreshes/closes the page that information is stored within the local storage of the users computer, allowing users to come back and view their tasks for that day.

Furthermore, added dynamic visual accessability where the time-blocks for each hour, appear as different colours, depending on the current hour of the day.
